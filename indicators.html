			<h4>Inflation</h4>
			<p>Inflation is the rate of change of prices in an economy. It is measured
			by calculating the annual growth rate of the GDP implicit deflator, which
			is the ratio of GDP in current local currency to GDP in constant local currency.  </P>

			<h4> Agriculture, Value Added (% of GDP) </h4>
			<p> Agriculture value added is the net output of the agriculture sector,
			including forestry, hunting and fishing, and cultivation of crops and livestock 
			production, after adding up all outputs and subtracting intermediate inputs. Deductions 
			for depreciation of fabricated assets and depletion and degradation of natural resources
			are not included in the calculation.

			<h4>Population Undernorished</h4>
			<p> Population undernourished is the percentage of a country's population that consistently
			has a food intake that is less than a minimum dietary energy consumption required for maintaining
			health and performing light physical activity. This requirement varies by country, and is calculated
			by looking at the amount of food available in a country and a measure of inequality in distribution
			developed using household income and expenditure surveys. The minimum requirement for dietary
			energy is usually between 1750 and 2030 kilocalories per person per day. The data is expressed
			as a country's average over a 3-year period.
